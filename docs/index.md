## Navigating the Website

The training website consists of five different sections:

* Overview
* Accessing Data
* Retrospective Data
* Forecast Data 
* Applications of GEOGLOWS Data

Each of these sections includes text, presentations, and Google Colab 
notebooks with information to help the user navigate GEOGLOWS on his/her own. 

If you are new to GEOGLOWS, start with the **Overview** section to gain a
foundational understanding of the organization. Then move to **Accessing Data**
to learn how to retrieve and use the data that GEOGLOWS offers.

If you are looking to understand where the Retrospective and Forecast 
data come from, start in the **Retrospective Data** or **Forecast Data** 
sections, respectively. And to see the impact and possible applications
of GEOGLOWS data, see the "Stories" in the **Overview** section or the 
**Applications** section.
