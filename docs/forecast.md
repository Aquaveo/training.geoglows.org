# Forecast Data

The GEOGLOWS model produces ensemble streamflow forecasts using data 
from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) 
ensemble system. Each forecast includes 52 ensemble members: 51 
low-resolution members with a 15-day forecast horizon, and 1 
high-resolution member with a 10-day horizon. The low-resolution 
members have a time resolution of 3-hour intervals, while the 
high-resolution member provides forecasts at 1-hour intervals. 
These forecasts offer probabilistic insights into future streamflow 
conditions, allowing users to assess potential variability.

Forecast plots are designed to help users interpret the range of 
possible outcomes and uncertainties. The most commonly used forecast 
plot presents the median, 20th percentile, and 80th percentile, 
which represent 60% of the probability distribution within the 
ensemble members. These statistics give insight into the potential
variability of future streamflows. This allows users to gauge the 
likelihood of different flow scenarios.
