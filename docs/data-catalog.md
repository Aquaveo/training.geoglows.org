# Using AWS Buckets

The **GEOGLOWS Hydrological Model Version 2** allows users to download global streamflow data directly from AWS. This provides access to both retrospective simulation data and 15-day streamflow forecasts. These datasets are hosted in S3 buckets, optimized for time series analysis and bulk downloads. 

Users can easily access and analyze these data using **Python** and **Jupyter notebooks**, with detailed tutorials available.

The following Collab notebooks demonstrate how to access the data from the AWS bucket using Python:  
- [Access GEOGLOWS retrospective simulation data from AWS S3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19f8n-YMqGxL_qcn3aw5yv4oYUFFlB8IK)

## Accessing Data Directly from AWS

Users can also download the data directly by visiting the AWS bucket here: [https://data.geoglows.org/available-data](https://data.geoglows.org/available-data). 

After selecting the S3 bucket of interest, users can navigate to the file they want to download. The interface will look like this:
