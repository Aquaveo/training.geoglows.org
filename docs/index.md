## Overview
GEOGLOWS is the Group on Earth Observation's (GEO) Global Water Sustainability Program. 
One of the offerings from this program is a global scale hydrologic model which provides daily forecasted streamflow and historical streamflow data back to 1940. This data and the many tools for using it are made possible through partnerships and collaborations with many government and non-government organizations. 
For more information about the GEOGLOWS program, please visit the [GEOGLOWS Website](https://geoglows.org).
