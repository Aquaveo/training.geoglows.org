## **Overview of Theory of Change for GEOGLOWS** 
Despite the advanced capabilities of current hydrological models, there is a significant gap between these models and the actual needs of the communities they are intended to serve. This disconnection arises primarily because the development of these models often lacks meaningful engagement with local populations and stakeholders. To bridge this gap GEOGLOWS attempts for the first time to include the Theory of Change (ToC). This involves actively involving local communities and stakeholders in the co-creation process, ensuring their needs and knowledge are integrated into the model. By doing so, the models can become more relevant, useful, and effective in addressing the specific hydrological challenges faced by different communities.

The ToC helps to understand and measure the societal impact of a co-created global hydrological model. For this, we will utilize the Theory of Change based on the Social Impact Cycle adapted for Hydrology. The ToC focuses on having an organized plan that dives deeper into how a given intervention is expected to trigger a chain of results that leads to achieving the outcome goal.

### **Social Impact**

Social Impact refers to the effects of activities, organizations, or policies on community well-being, covering areas like the economy, environment, health, education, and social cohesion. This approach facilitates continuous feedback and iteration throughout the process, promoting effective co-creation. To initiate this process, consider the following questions:

- What will you improve? 
- What problem will you address? 
- What steps will you take? 
- How will you measure success? 
- How can you increase impact? 

The Social Approach to hydrology will encompass two main directions, as illustrated in Figure 2. The initial phase of the Social Approach emphasizes establishing a deeper collaboration with National Hydrological Services (NHS) as key stakeholders, utilizing the GEOGLOWS model as the operational tool. Once the implementation and adaptation phases are completed, the NHS will take the lead in expanding and ensuring equitable use of the model.

In other words, the Social Impact Approach shows what needs to happen to achieve our goals.

Essentially, adapting the Theory of Change  into a hydrological model will allow changemakers to measure impact while also creating a relationship between the collaborator and the stakeholder. This approach is divided into 4 phases: 

1. Assessment 
2. Planning & Design 
3. Implementation & Adaptation 
4. Expansion & Equity

Figure 2, Social Impact Cycle for Hydrology


The Social Impact Cycle presented here has been adapted from Brigham Young University’s Ballard Center for Hydrology and it is based on the slogan “Love the Problem, Not the Solution”. This allows change makers to turn their focus less on the solution, addressing  the solution based on a deeper understanding of the problem by creating meaningful relationships with the community and focusing on their needs.

**Why "Love the Problem, Not the Solution"?**

What does it mean to love the problem rather than love the solution?

To love the problem more than the solution indicates loving the people more than a particular “fix.” When this is the case, interventions often do not evolve upon the receipt of new information. 

Things rarely go right the first time they are tried. The first idea is seldom the best. Sometimes even the second, third, and fourth iterations aren’t quite right. This is why evolving interventions are an essential part of co-creation.
The co-creation of  a model attempts to maintain the long sustainability of the model and increase the impact of using it.

Imagine you’re baking a cake and you’ve never baked anything before, but you randomly had the urge to just bake something. With absolutely no idea what you’re doing, you know to get a bowl out and begin. You start throwing baking ingredients together, such as flour, milk, baking powder, eggs, sugar, and whatever else you can think of. You combine all of these ingredients and put it in the oven to bake it. Assuming you were lucky enough to make something without starting a fire, what you have made is most-likely not edible or at least not good. 

When we set out to do something, big or small, the biggest thing that motivates us to push forward is the end goal in mind. Without it, we would have no guidance and may never accomplish the task at hand. When it comes to social impact, as we begin to gain an understanding for the problem, we tend to get impatient and want to fix this problem as quickly as we can. This is where understanding social impact becomes very important.

## **Phase I: Assessments**

Once we have our initial theory of change in place, our next step is determining what our outcome goals should be and designing an intervention to help us get there.

**Identify and Understand**

When we initially create a Theory of Change we organize what we learn into five fundamental categories: 

1.Identify the Problem

In order to identify the problem, you must begin by understanding the needs of the society and their social issues. A good start is to check beforehand if there is a comprehensive understand of the social issue, which includes asking a few questions such as:

- Are the root causes of the problem clearly defined? 
- Is there enough data and research to back up the identified needs? 
- Are the stakeholders and their needs accurately identified and consulted?

This does not mean learning everything there is to know about the issue at hand, but rather allowing it to be framed in a way that helps us to move forward. In the beginning, all we need is a desire and a willingness to help, because there is so much to learn about the problem at hand. As you learn more about the problem, you should take into consideration what the quality and feasibility of the proposed solutions are like. Ask yourself questions like:

- Are the solutions designed based on thorough research and stakeholder input?
- Do the solutions align with the identified needs and root causes?
- Is there a clear and practical plan for implementation?

Once you've identified the problem you care about, you must then focus on a particular population or geographical area.

2.Establish context

Each problem has its roots in a particular sociocultural, economic, and environmental setting. An effective solution in one context might not work in another. In order to comprehend the context of a given problem, we need to consider the five W questions of journalism: 

- Who? 
- What? 
- When? 
- Where? 
- Why? 

It is important that no matter where these social impact groups are located, that the main focus is helping the local community and those that are most affected by the problem at hand. 

3.Understand contributing factors

On the surface, many issues can appear effortless with obvious causes and readily apparent solutions. Upon closer examination, we can discover hidden obstacles that when put together, cause our societal problems. Understanding these pieces is crucial, as they can assist us when making decisions, provide insight into the main causes of our issues, and direct us toward potential workable solutions.

4.Identify negative consequences

Negative consequences inspire us to do research that helps us to better understand the issue. Focusing on the various categories that they fit into is helpful when considering the repercussions because it allows us to be specific and clear about the results of the social issue. Observe how every category addresses a distinct aspect of human existence.

5.Investigate current practices 

This includes asking yourself:
- What is already being done to alleviate the suffering caused by this issue? 
- What are the current methods in focus? 
- How successful are current interventions?

Rather than focusing on designing a new solution or testing your own ideas, you should turn your focus to comparing notes with fellow change makers that have already spent time dedicated to tackling this issue. We need to examine what has and has not worked, as well as the experiences of those most impacted by the problem as well as those involved in its solution. 

## **Phase II: Planning and Design**

**Co-Creation Intervention**


The term co-creation intervention is a cooperative method of developing and putting into practice ideas or solutions. In this instance, co-creation requires involving stakeholders in the process of problem identification and intervention development, including students, community members, patients, and staff. Through the incorporation of the thoughts, needs, and expertise of those who are directly affected, the aim is to make sure that the solutions are the most relevant, effective, and sustainable that they can be. 

**Ecosystem Map**

To make ecosystem changes more systematic, social entrepreneurs should create a comprehensive map of their ecosystem, which includes identifying all of the key players, environmental conditions, and the relationships among them. They should define their organization’s ultimate intended impact and outline the steps they will take in order to achieve that impact, which is defining their Theory of Change. Additionally, they should identify the various components of their ecosystem, including individuals, organizations, and environmental conditions that could influence their ability to effect sustainable change.

**Logic Model**

A logic model is a visual representation of a Theory of Change. Typically, it illustrates the inputs, activities, and resulting outcomes of an intervention. Logic models are widely used in impact-focused practices, though their format may vary between organizations. The most effective logic models are created through backward mapping.

## **Phase III: Implementation and Adaptation**

**Output, Outcome, and Impact**
Output and outcome are not a regular part of most people’s vocabulary, but impact is. Impact can be a troublesome word for many who are new to the world of social problem-solving because the word impact can be used in various situations throughout everyday conversation. When describing what outputs, outcomes, and impact are, it's helpful to start with outputs, followed by outcomes, and then impact.

**Output**: These are the immediate, tangible products or services generated by a program or activity. Outputs are often quantifiable and directly attributable to the actions taken. For example, the number of workshops conducted, reports published, or people trained are considered outputs.

If the result is a measurement of the negative consequences of the social problem then the result is an outcome. All other measurement or evaluation results are outputs.

**Two Basic Types of Outputs**

Common outputs: these tend to be simple counts like the following:
- number of people working with GEOGLOWS
- number of countries using GEOGLOWS
- number of GEOGLOWS trainings
- number of applications that use data from GEOGLOWS

Another type of output is nuanced outputs. These provide additional insights and help us understand the nuance of stakeholder relationships and needs. Some stakeholders do not finish a set of courses. Others may find that the intervention is not helping them. They are often described as percentages giving us averages and other simple statistical information like the following:

- percent of river systems with accurate streamflow forecasts
- percent of stakeholders needing GEOGLOWS services but lack the resources to access them
- percent of regions experiencing improved water management and reduced flood risk
- percent of regions with increased water security and availability
- percent of regions previously facing water scarcity now experiencing sustainable water levels 
- etc.

**Outcomes**: These are the short- and medium-term effects or changes that result from the outputs. Outcomes reflect the extent to which the program or activity has achieved its objectives and can include changes in behavior, attitudes, knowledge, skills, or conditions. For example, increased knowledge about water conservation practices among participants who attended a workshop.

**Impact**: This refers to the long-term, significant changes that occur as a result of the program or activity. Impact is broader and more enduring, often reflecting fundamental shifts in conditions or systems. Unlike outputs and outcomes, impact is less directly attributable to specific activities and can be influenced by various factors. For example, improved water quality and availability in a region due to sustained water conservation efforts.

With the definition of outputs comes an adjacent definition for thinking about its relationship with outcomes:

**OUTPUTS vs OUTCOMES**

Outcomes are the ultimate results we aim to achieve, reflecting the impact or changes brought about by our efforts. On the other hand, outputs measure the tangible products or services delivered, serving as the means through which we strive to reach those desired outcomes. For example, if a hydrological intervention leads to a measurable decrease in the frequency and severity of flooding in a region, that result is an outcome. All other measurements or evaluation results are outputs. 

**Outcome and Impact**

One of the ways that we use impact in normal day use is as a substitute for reach or even possible reach. If GEOGLOWS measures ‘their impact’ and then mention how many river systems they have helped with streamflow data in a recent time frame. 

**Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact**

IMPACT is a measurement of the portion of a hydrological outcome that is caused by a specific intervention or practice. For example: "Our watershed management practices contributed to a 2% reduction in flood frequency, within an overall 5% reduction observed in the GEOGLOWS hydrological forecasts"

There are two things to note about this definition:

1. First, to calculate impact, GEOGLOWS must measure the outcomes of negative hydrological consequences (such as flood damage, water scarcity, etc.) based on their intervention practices. The goal is to capture a comprehensive dataset that reflects the actual changes in hydrological conditions due to these interventions.

2. Second, the hydrological model needs to measure the outcomes of negative hydrological consequences for populations similar to GEOGLOWS’ customers who do not engage in GEOGLOWS’ intervention practices. 

The differences between these two outcomes is the positive or negative impact caused by GEOGLOWS. 

**Impact is always linked to causation**: What portion of GEOGLOWS’ outcomes are caused by its intervention?
