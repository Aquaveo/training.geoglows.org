# The REST API

The **GEOGLOWS ECMWF Streamflow Service** provides programmatic access to streamflow data through a **REST API**, allowing users to easily integrate global hydrological data into their applications. With this API, developers and researchers can retrieve historical and forecasted streamflow data in **CSV** or **JSON** format, enabling custom analysis and visualization. The API provides access to all **retrospective** and **forecast** data.

For more information, visit the [GEOGLOWS API Documentation](https://geoglows.ecmwf.int/documentation).

## Using the API in Applications

The API can be used in applications requiring streamflow data and can be integrated directly into Python workflows. 

The following resources provide guidance:
