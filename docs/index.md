## Navigating the Website

The first page on this site gives a brief overview of GEOGLOWS and its history. After that, the bulk of the training section begins. This training is broken down into 3 main sections, each having different sub sections within them. We recommend you start with the first section (Available Data) before progressing to the second section (Accessing Data). The third section (Skills and Examples) is a more advanced section designed for people looking to complete specific tasks using the GEOGLOWS data who already have a good understanding of the first two sections. As you are learning about the data, there is also a website available with more information on how to download and use the GEOGLOWS data: https://data.geoglows.org/. This is a great resource once you have a basic understanding of the data. Here is a brief overview of what you can expect to learn: 
 
1. **Available Data** - This section details the available datasets through GEOGLOWS. It is divided into 3 sections:  
    - **a. GIS Data** - Learn about the hydrography data used in the GEOGLOWS model, including stream centerlines, catchment boundaries, and their unique identifiers, derived from high-resolution elevation products.  
    - **b. Retrospective River Discharge** - Explore over 85 years of daily average streamflow data, derived from meteorological reanalysis and updated weekly, offering insights into historical river discharge.  
    - **c. Forecast River Discharge** - Understand daily river flow forecasts with a 51-member ensemble providing detailed predictions at 3-hour intervals, including uncertainty ranges for better planning.  

2. **Accessing Data** - This section explains how the previously described data can be accessed and downloaded using 4 different techniques. Each section will detail a different technique:  
    - **a. A Data Catalog** - This section explains the data catalog available through AWS buckets.  
    - **b. A Data Service** - This section describes how to use our REST API to access GEOGLOWS data.  
    - **c. A Web Map** - This section explains the Esri Living Atlas map layer that can be loaded into any GIS software (ArcGIS or QGIS).  
    - **d. A Web App** - This section introduces you to the HydroViewer, which is our web application that allows for easy visualization and download of data globally.  

3. **Skills and Examples** - This section explains more advanced techniques that can be used when using the data for specific purposes.  
    - **a. Accessing and Interpreting Data** - This section includes Google Colab notebooks that show you how to use the GEOGLOWS Python package to make and customize your streamflow plots.  
    - **b. Bias Correction and SABER Overview** - This section gives a brief overview of bias correction and a technique called SABER that applies bias correction to other areas.  
    - **c. Bias Correction for Forecast Data** - This section provides a notebook that goes through examples of bias-correcting the forecast data.
